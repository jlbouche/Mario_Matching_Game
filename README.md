# Mario Matching

## What is Mario Matching?

### Mario matching is a take on the classic Memory game, designed to test your memory with a deck of cards to see if you can find each card's match.

## Instructions:

### Click on two face-down cards at a time to turn them face-up. If it's a match, they will stay face-up! Otherwise, they will return to face-down and you will have to guess again to find the correct match. Try to remember what card is where! You have 3 'lives' to make an incorrect guess. Good luck!
